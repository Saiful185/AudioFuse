# **AudioFuse**
The notebook in this folder contains the end-to-end implementation of our proposed **AudioFuse** and also its baseline models for comparision on PASCAL dataset. We used the PhysioNet 2016 Challenge dataset (Heart Sound Classification/Abnormality Detection) to pretrain our model. Now, we test the generalizability of this model using the PASCAL dataset.
